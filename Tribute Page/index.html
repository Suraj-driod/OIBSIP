                <h2>A Pioneer Against All Odds</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, Marie Curie faced obstacles that would have deterred most. 
                    Women were barred from higher education in Russian-controlled Poland. Did that stop her? 
                    She attended underground "floating universities" and eventually made her way to Paris with little 
                    more than determination and an insatiable hunger for knowledge.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a cramped, leaky shed that served as her laboratory, she discovered not one but two new elements: 
                    polonium (named after her homeland) and radium. She coined the very term "radioactivity." 
                    She became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and remains the only person to win Nobel Prizes 
                    in two different sciences.
                </p>

                        <h3>Relentless Curiosity</h3>
                        <p>
                            She spent four years manually processing tons of pitchblende ore to isolate a single gram of radium. 
                            That level of dedication to understanding the unknown is almost incomprehensible.

                        <h3>Breaking Barriers</h3>
                        <p>
                            In an era when women were expected to stay home, she became a professor at the Sorbonne, 
                            the first woman to hold such a position. She didn't ask for permission—she simply excelled.

                        <h3>Selfless Service</h3>
                        <p>
                            During World War I, she equipped ambulances with portable X-ray machines and drove them 
                            to the front lines herself. She trained 150 women as X-ray technicians. Science, for her, 
                            was always about helping humanity.

                    Marie Curie's notebooks are still so radioactive that they must be kept in lead-lined boxes. 
                    Anyone who wishes to view them must wear protective clothing. She literally gave her life 
                    to science—dying of aplastic anemia caused by radiation exposure.

                    Her legacy isn't just in her discoveries. It's in proving that passion, persistence, 
                    and an uncompromising commitment to truth can overcome any barrier society erects.
